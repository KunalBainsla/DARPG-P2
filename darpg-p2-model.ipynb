Redress of citizen\\'s grievances, being one of the most important initiatives of the\\ndepartment, DAR&PG formulates public grievance redress mechanisms for e\\x00ective and timely redress / settlement of citizen\\'s grievances.\\nThe DAR&PG has been making endeavors to bring excellence in public service delivery and to redress grievances of citizens in a meaningful manner\\nby e\\x00ectively coordinating with di\\x00erent Ministries and Departments of the Government and trying to eliminate the causes of grievances.\\nThis is a Government of India Portal aimed at providing the citizens with a platform for redress of their grievances. If you have any grievance\\nagainst any Government organization in the country, you may lodge your grievance here which will go to the Ministry/Department/State\\nGovernment concerned for immediate redress.\\nDepartment of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) had signed a memorandum of understanding for developing Artificial\\nIntelligence Machine Learning techniques apart from other New Generation technologies to analyse public grievances. The web portal of IGMS (\\nhttps://dashboard-pmopg.nic.in/igms2/sign-in) launched by DARPG in collaboration with IIT Kanpur helps implement Artificial Intelligence (AI)\\nand Machine Learning (ML) techniques to conduct an exploratory and predictive analysis of public grievances received on the web-based\\nCentralised Public Grievances Redress and Monitoring System.Other new generation technology of DARPG has launched for CPGRAMS are\\navailable in the portal : http://www.treedashboard.in\\nPresently, in addition to flagging urgent grievances using Artificial Intelligence, the Intelligent Grievance Management System (IGMS) deployed by\\nDARPG in CPGRAMS also functions as a module within CPGRAMS 7.0 and performs the following functions:\\nAutomatically detects spam, bulk and repetitive grievances in real-time.\\nAutomatically identifies the semantic gist of grievances by analyzing their text contents and pdf attachments\\nAutomatically detects important clusters of topics,reflecting issues that multiple citizens are complaining about with respect to a\\ndepartment or a scheme\\nEnables spatiotemporal filtering of themes and topics being reflected in grievances, to facilitate identification of both policy-level and\\nimplementation-level root causes of grievance production\\nAny query/comments/discrepancies may be communicated to Department of Administrative Reforms & Public Grievances as per the following Contact\\nAddress:\\nParthasarthy Bhaskar\\nDirector (PG)\\nThe Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances., Sardar Patel Bhawan\\nParliament Street, New Delhi 110 001\\n23440439\\nDisclaimer\\nThis Site is Designed, Developed & Hosted by NIC.
